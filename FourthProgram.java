//Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial
//temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the
//amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. The
//formula to compute the energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
//where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and
//energy Q is measured in joules.
